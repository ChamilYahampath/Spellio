Instructions

• This is a puzzle game based on the popular hangman concept. The player's spelling 
knowledge will be tested through this game.

• First, they have to Choose a person as a "host". The host will invent the puzzle and the 
rest of them have to solve it (remember - since c++ is case sensitive we have to type 
'host' with simple letters). The host should have the ability to spell confidently. 
Otherwise, it's too hard to win.

• If the player was selected as host, he should choose a secret word. The word must be 
difficult to guess. Those kinds of words usually have uncommon letters like 'z', 'q', and 
only a few vowels.

• once the word has been selected game will display how many letters do they need for 
the player who going to guess the word, to find the secret word, they have to begin with 
selecting relevant letters for the secret word.

• Whenever a player guesses a wrong Letter, he/ she will get a strike and it will it will bring 
them closer to the ending part. To show this, the game will display a simple strike figure 
of a hanging man, it will add an extra Strike for every wrong answer.
